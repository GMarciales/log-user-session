log-user-session README
-----------------------
log-user-session is a program to store the content of a shell session (e.g via
ssh) e.g. for auditing purposes. The tool is intended to be started by the ssh
server daemon. The log is tamper-proof for non-root users.

Current maintainer:
   Konrad Bucheli <kb@open.ch>

Dependencies
-------------
A C compiler and `make` must be installed prior to installation. You need also
`autoconf` if you get the source code not via official release tarball (e.g.
via git or via automatic generated github source tarballs).
On a Debian-based Linux distribution, they can be installed like this:

    sudo apt-get install autoconf gcc make

Installation
------------
If you want to install log-user-session from source, proceed as follows:

1. Run `[ -f ./configure ] || ./autogen.sh` to generate the `configure` file if
   it is not ready yet

2. Run `./configure`. You might first review any options with 
   `./configure --help`. The defaults are likely fine.

3. Run `make`

4. Run `sudo make install`

5. Have a look at `man log-user-session` for usage help.  

6. Create the configuration file /etc/log-user-session.conf and integrate the 
   tool into your sshd configuration.


Supported Platforms
-------------------
This tool has been so far only tested on Linux.
